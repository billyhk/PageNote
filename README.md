## Installation (Chrome Browser)

1. Open Chrome.
2. Access Extensions Page: Navigate to the Chrome Extensions page by entering chrome://extensions/ in the address bar.
3. Enable Developer Mode: At the top-right corner of the Extensions page, find the "Developer mode" toggle and ensure it is turned on. This will reveal additional options necessary for loading unpacked extensions.
4. Load Unpacked Extension: Click the "Load unpacked" button which becomes visible after enabling Developer Mode. This allows you to select and load your extension's directory.
5. Select Extension Folder: In the file dialog that opens, navigate to the directory where your Chrome extension's files are located (this folder should contain the manifest.json file and other extension assets). Select the folder and click "Open".
6. Verify Extension Loaded: After selecting the folder, Chrome will process the files and load the extension. You should now see your extension listed among others on the chrome://extensions/ page, indicating it has been successfully loaded.
7. Check Extension Icon: If your extension has a UI component or icon, look for its icon next to the Chrome address bar. If it's not visible, you may need to pin it by clicking the Extensions (puzzle piece) icon and then the pin next to your extension's name.
8. Test the Extension: Navigate to a webpage where you wish to test the extension's functionality and ensure everything works as expected.
